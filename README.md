Hi there, unfortunately I couldn't finish the task, But it was fun, and the reason isn't about being to hard for me, I just realized to late, and also I have no such time to do that complex staff I am in the middle of exams at the university and I also I work full time job so If I might have a bit more time, but nevermind maybe next time I know the consequences about not doing most of the project, But actually I had some fun while doing it basically I have used node.js to create this particular project used watch sass by means of nodejs. I didn't struggle at all doing front coz I love to do it and I think I am pretty good at it, but I know there are plenty things to change in the finall project but it's hard to do it without any adoby programs witch I dont have access to coz of luck of license from jpg it's hard to guess I've used some online tools but... Thank you for your time. In case of any other recruitmens I am interested and maybe I will try to do whole project also with the most importnant part react/js.
Wish you luck and all best :D
